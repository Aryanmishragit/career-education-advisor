# ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement 

---

## Background
The decline in student enrollment in government degree colleges is not due to poor infrastructure or teaching resources.  
The real issue is **lack of awareness** among students and parents.  

After Class 10 or 12, students face confusion:
- Which stream to choose (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational)?
- What kind of degree programs are available in nearby government colleges?
- What career opportunities or higher studies are possible after a particular course?
- Is pursuing graduation worth it compared to short-term skill/job courses?

This lack of clarity leads to poor academic decisions, dropouts, or migration to private institutions (which often fail to deliver quality education).

## Problem Description
- Students and parents do not understand the **importance of graduation**.  
- They are unaware of the **career opportunities different degree courses unlock**.  
- They lack proper guidance in choosing **subject streams** based on interest and future scope.  
- Many government degree colleges remain under-enrolled, despite having good infrastructure.  

---

## Why This Matters
- Wrong career decisions at an early stage â†’ long-term consequences.  
- Dropouts after Class 10 and 12 continue to rise.  
- Government colleges are ignored despite being affordable and resourceful.  
- Students migrate to private institutions unnecessarily.

## Need
A **Digital Guidance Platform** is required that acts as a **one-stop personalized career & education advisor**.  

This platform should:  
- Guide students in selecting the right subject stream.  
- Show career opportunities for each degree.  
- Provide directory of nearby government colleges.  
- Track timelines for admissions, scholarships, and exams.  
- Offer personalized recommendations using AI.
