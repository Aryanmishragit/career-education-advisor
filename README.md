# 🎓 Career & Education Advisor
*A one-stop personalized career & education advisor for students after Class 10 & 12.*

## 🚩 Problem
Students and parents are often confused after Class 10/12:
- Which stream to choose (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational)?
- What courses are available in nearby government colleges?
- What careers are possible after different degrees?
- Is graduation worth it compared to short-term courses?

This confusion leads to poor choices, dropouts, and low enrollment in government colleges.

- Aptitude quiz to suggest the best stream/courses.
