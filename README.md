# 🎓 Career & Education Advisor
*A one-stop personalized career & education advisor for students after Class 10 & 12.*

---

## 🚩 Problem
Many students and parents face **confusion after Class 10 & 12**:
- Which stream to choose (Arts, Science, Commerce, Vocational)?
- What courses are available in nearby government colleges?
- What career opportunities exist after different degrees?
- Is graduation worth it compared to short-term skill courses?

This lack of clarity results in:
- Wrong academic choices  
- Dropouts after school  
- Low enrollment in government colleges

## 💡 Our Solution
We are building a **Digital Guidance Platform** (Web + Mobile) to guide students in making the right academic and career choices.  

### Key Highlights:
- 🎯 Aptitude & Interest Quiz → Personalized stream/career suggestions  
- 🗺️ Course-to-Career Path Mapping → Visual career journeys after each degree  
- 🏫 Nearby Government Colleges Directory → Location-based listing with cutoffs & facilities  
- ⏰ Timeline Tracker → Admissions, exams, scholarships reminders  
- 👤 Personalized Profiles → AI-powered recommendations for students

- **Frontend (Mobile):** React Native  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
